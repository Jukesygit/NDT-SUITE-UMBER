## Training Content

Training must cover:

1. **What personal data is** — names, emails, addresses, qualification records, anything that identifies a person
2. **Data protection principles** — lawful, fair, transparent, purpose-limited, minimised, accurate, time-limited, secure
3. **Recognising a Subject Access Request** — any request for personal data, regardless of wording
4. **Reporting a data breach** — who to contact, how quickly (immediately), what to preserve
5. **System-specific rules**:
   - PII is masked on personnel views — reveals are logged
   - Don't share login credentials
   - Don't export data and store it outside the system
   - Don't discuss personal data in shared channels (Slack, Teams)
   - Lock your screen when away from your desk
