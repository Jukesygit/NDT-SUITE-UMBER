# Data Protection Officer (DPO) — Appointment Decision

> **Data Controller**: [YOUR COMPANY NAME]
> **Date**: 2026-02-20
> **Review Date**: 2027-02-20

## Requirement Assessment

Under UK GDPR Article 37, a DPO must be appointed if the organisation:

1. **Is a public authority** — No. [YOUR COMPANY NAME] is a private company.
2. **Carries out large-scale systematic monitoring of individuals** — No. NDT Suite logs user actions for security/audit but does not systematically monitor behaviour, location, or performance.
3. **Carries out large-scale processing of special category data** — No. The data processed (contact details, qualifications, employment records) is not special category data under Article 9.

## Decision

Based on the above assessment, **a DPO is not legally required**.

However, given that [YOUR COMPANY NAME] processes employee personal data across multiple organisations in a regulated industry, a **designated data protection point of contact** is appointed to fulfil an equivalent role on a proportionate basis.

## Designated Data Protection Contact

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Name** | [NAME] |
| **Role** | [ROLE — e.g., Operations Director, CTO] |
| **Email** | [EMAIL] |
| **Responsibilities** | See below |

## Responsibilities

The designated contact is responsible for:

- Responding to data subject requests (SARs, erasure requests, complaints)
- Acting as the point of contact for the ICO
- Monitoring compliance with UK GDPR and this documentation
- Conducting or commissioning the annual data protection audit
- Maintaining the breach register and coordinating breach response
- Reviewing and updating the DPIA, ROPA, and retention schedule annually
- Ensuring staff receive data protection training

## Escalation

If the volume or complexity of data processing increases (e.g., processing data for more than 250 organisations, processing health data, or expanding to automated decision-making), this decision must be reviewed and a formal DPO appointment considered.
