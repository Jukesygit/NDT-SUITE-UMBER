# React Router Migration Complete

## What Changed

Your app now uses **React + React Router** for proper client-side routing instead of manual tool switching.

## New URLs

All tools now have clean, bookmarkable URLs:

- `/` - Data Hub (home)
- `/profile` - User Profile
- `/admin` - Admin Dashboard (admin only)
- `/tofd` - TOFD Calculator
- `/cscan` - C-Scan Visualizer
- `/pec` - PEC Visualizer
- `/3d` - 3D Model Viewer
- `/nii` - NII Coverage Calculator
- `/login` - Login Page

## Benefits

✅ **Clean URLs** - Bookmarkable, shareable links
✅ **Browser Navigation** - Back/forward buttons work properly
✅ **Protected Routes** - Admin-only pages automatically redirect
✅ **Better UX** - No full page reloads, instant navigation
✅ **SEO Ready** - Each route has its own URL

## Architecture

### Key Files

- [src/App.jsx](src/App.jsx) - Main app with route definitions
- [src/main.jsx](src/main.jsx) - React entry point
- [src/components/Layout.jsx](src/components/Layout.jsx) - Sidebar navigation with React Router Links
- [src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx](src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx) - Auth & admin protection
- [src/pages/](src/pages/) - Page components that wrap your vanilla JS tools

### How It Works

1. **React Router** handles URL changes
2. **ProtectedRoute** checks authentication
3. **Layout** component provides sidebar navigation
4. **Page components** wrap your existing vanilla JS tools

Your existing tool logic (`data-hub.js`, `tofd-calculator.js`, etc.) still works as-is! The page components simply mount them into React.

## Testing

The dev server is running at http://localhost:5173/

Try:
- Navigating between tools using the sidebar
- Using browser back/forward buttons
- Bookmarking a specific tool URL
- Accessing `/admin` (only works if you're an admin)

## Old Code

The old [src/main.js](src/main.js) is still there but no longer used. You can keep it as reference or delete it.

## Next Steps (Optional)

To further improve the app, you could:

1. **Convert tools to React components** - Gradually rewrite vanilla JS tools as React components
2. **Add route transitions** - Smooth animations between pages
3. **Implement lazy loading** - Load tool code only when needed
4. **Add breadcrumbs** - Show navigation hierarchy
5. **Deep linking** - Support query parameters for tool state
