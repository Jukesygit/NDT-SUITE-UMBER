# Asset Sharing Integration Checklist

## ✅ Database Setup - COMPLETE
- [x] `shared_assets` table created
- [x] `asset_access_requests` table created
- [x] All 6 database functions created
- [x] RLS policies configured
- [x] Verification successful

## 📋 Frontend Integration Steps

### Step 1: Verify File Structure
Make sure these files exist in your project:

```
src/
├── sharing-manager.js                    ✓ Created
├── data-manager.js                       ✓ Existing
├── auth-manager.js                       ✓ Existing
└── tools/
    ├── admin-dashboard.js                ✓ Updated
    └── asset-access-request.js           ✓ Created
```

### Step 2: Register the Asset Access Request Tool
Add this tool to your main application so users can access it.

**Find your tool registration code** (usually in `main.js` or similar):

```javascript
// Example: If you have a tools object
import assetAccessRequest from './tools/asset-access-request.js';

// Register the tool
const tools = {
    'data-hub': dataHub,
    'admin-dashboard': adminDashboard,
    'asset-access-request': assetAccessRequest,  // ← Add this line
    // ... other tools
};
```

**Or if you have a menu/navigation system:**

```javascript
const toolsMenu = [
    { id: 'data-hub', name: 'Data Hub', icon: '📊', tool: dataHub },
    { id: 'admin-dashboard', name: 'Admin', icon: '⚙️', tool: adminDashboard },
    { id: 'asset-access-request', name: 'Request Access', icon: '🔑', tool: assetAccessRequest },  // ← Add this
    // ... other tools
];
```

### Step 3: Test the Complete Workflow

#### 3.1 Admin: Share an Asset
1. Login as admin user
2. Go to **Admin Dashboard** → **Asset Sharing** tab
3. Click **"+ Share Asset"**
4. Select an asset, target organization, and permission level
5. Verify share appears in "Active Shares" section

#### 3.2 User: Request Access
1. Login as regular user (different organization)
2. Open **Asset Access Requests** tool (find it in your menu)
3. Click **"+ New Request"**
4. Enter:
   - Organization that owns the asset
   - Asset ID (get this from the owner's data hub)
   - Permission level (view/edit)
   - Optional message
5. Submit request
6. Verify request appears in "Pending Requests" section

#### 3.3 Admin: Approve Request
1. Switch back to admin user
2. Go to **Admin Dashboard** → **Asset Sharing** tab
3. See request in "Pending Access Requests" section
4. Click **"Approve"**
5. Verify:
   - Request disappears from pending
   - New share appears in "Active Shares"
   - User now has access to the asset

#### 3.4 User: Access Shared Asset
1. Switch back to regular user
2. Check **Asset Access Requests** tool - status should be "Approved"
3. Go to **Data Hub** and verify shared asset is now visible

## 🔍 Quick Feature Test

### Test 1: Direct Sharing (Admin)
```
Admin Dashboard → Asset Sharing → + Share Asset
→ Select asset → Select org → Approve
→ Check "Active Shares" section ✓
```

### Test 2: Request & Approve Flow
```
User: Asset Access Requests → + New Request
→ Fill details → Submit
→ Status: Pending ✓

Admin: Asset Sharing → Pending Access Requests
→ Click Approve
→ Share auto-created ✓

User: Asset Access Requests → Refresh
→ Status: Approved ✓
```

### Test 3: Request & Reject Flow
```
User: Create another request
Admin: Click Reject → Enter reason
User: Check request → See rejection reason ✓
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Admin Dashboard - Asset Sharing Tab Shows:
- ✅ Pending access requests (if any)
- ✅ Your assets with "Share" buttons
- ✅ Active shares list with Edit/Remove actions

### Asset Access Request Tool Shows:
- ✅ Pending requests (yellow badge)
- ✅ Approved requests (green badge)
- ✅ Rejected requests with reasons (red badge)
- ✅ Ability to cancel pending requests

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Asset Access Requests" tool not found
**Solution**: Make sure you registered the tool in your main application file

### Issue: Admin Dashboard doesn't show Asset Sharing tab
**Solution**: Verify `sharingManager` is imported in admin-dashboard.js:
```javascript
import sharingManager from '../sharing-manager.js';
```

### Issue: "Only admins can share assets" error
**Solution**: Verify logged-in user has 'admin' role in profiles table

### Issue: Access requests not appearing
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `sharingManager.getPendingAccessRequests()` is being called
3. Check RLS policies allow viewing

### Issue: Supabase connection errors
**Solution**: Verify `supabase-client.js` is properly configured with your Supabase URL and anon key

## 📊 Feature Usage Metrics

Track these to monitor adoption:
- Number of shares created
- Number of access requests submitted
- Approval vs rejection rate
- Most shared assets
- Organizations with most sharing activity

```sql
-- Quick stats query
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shared_assets) as total_shares,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM asset_access_requests WHERE status = 'pending') as pending_requests,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM asset_access_requests WHERE status = 'approved') as approved_requests,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM asset_access_requests WHERE status = 'rejected') as rejected_requests;
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Consider adding:
- [ ] Email notifications when requests are approved/rejected
- [ ] Push notifications for new requests
- [ ] Bulk approval for multiple requests
- [ ] Request expiration (auto-reject after X days)
- [ ] Activity log/audit trail
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Sharing templates
- [ ] Auto-approval rules

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Supabase logs for database errors
3. Verify RLS policies aren't blocking operations
4. Ensure user has correct role permissions

## ✨ You're Ready!

The complete permission-based asset sharing system is now set up and ready to use. Users can:
- 🔑 Request access to assets from other organizations
- 👥 Admins can approve/reject with reasons
- 🤝 Shares are automatically created on approval
- 📊 Track all requests with full audit trail

Happy sharing! 🎉
