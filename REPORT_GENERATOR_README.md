3. Update the metadata collection in the dialog's `handleGenerate()` method

## Troubleshooting

### Report generation fails
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify vessel has scan data

### Images not appearing
- Check that scan thumbnails are properly saved
- Verify vessel images are uploaded correctly
- Large images may take time to process

### DOCX files won't open
- Ensure Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or compatible software is installed
- Try re-generating the report
- Check file isn't corrupted during download

### PDF formatting issues
- Large images may affect layout
- Try reducing image sizes in scans
- Verify browser supports PDF generation

## Best Practices

1. **Always fill in the Report Number**: This is critical for tracking and organization
2. **Use consistent naming**: Follow your organization's naming conventions
3. **Add findings and recommendations**: These make reports more valuable
4. **Generate multiple formats**: Keep DOCX for editing, PDF for distribution
5. **Review before distributing**: Open and review generated reports before sending to clients
6. **Save to appropriate location**: Move reports from Downloads to proper project folders
